# snowtree: snowflake fractal generator
Bart Massey

This Python code will generate an SVG snowflake fractal in
the file `snowtree.svg` in the current directory. You can
give it a seed string argument and it will use that to seed
the RNG. Otherwise it will pick a random integer seed and
report it on stdout.
